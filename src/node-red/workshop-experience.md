## Redesign the App

Let's say we are unhappy with our app and want to make some changes.  You would normally hire a developer, make changes, zip up the new app, deploy to Edge Manager and then on to all your devices.

The Predix Edge architecture is built around Publish/Subscribe messaging topics in Docker containers.  The demo team added the open source tool Node Red below, which by itself does not have the full feature set of Predix Edge, but is a good tool to quickly add and view JavaScript functions in the data flow.

This is something you would do at Design (or Redesign) time, not in the field on the deployed devices.
