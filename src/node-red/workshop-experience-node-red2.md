## Edge Manager

With Edge Manager you can securely manage all your devices.  You can remotely monitor, configure and push apps to them with ease.

## Predix APM

Predix APM optimizes the performance of your assets.  The tool helps increase asset reliability and availability while optimizing maintenance costs, mitigating your operational risk and reducing total cost of ownership.

In the Predix Cloud we have 4 more components

- **Predix Edge Manager** - Monitor and Optimize your Assets
- **Predix APM** - Monitor and Optimize your Assets
- **Predix UAA** - provides Oauth security
- **Predix Time Series** - Time Series data store for sensor and calculated data

## Predix Webapp Starter

In case you don't have APM, [Webapp Starter](https://stage.predix.io/resources/tutorials/journey.html#2100) is a custom Predix UI cloud application that shows how to build Predix UI based visualizations using the [design framework](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/home/).  It also can demonstrate custom integration to UAA, Predix Asset and Predix Timeseries when installed as the [Predix RMD Reference App](https://stage.predix.io/resources/tutorials/journey.html#1610).
