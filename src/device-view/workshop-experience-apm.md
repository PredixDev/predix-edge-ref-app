## Edge Experience Successful

You have completed your Edge experience.  Now, as a Reliability Engineer, Analyst or Supervisor persona you are ready to view your data in the Predix Cloud.  We have provided two options.  

## 1. Monitor and Optimize Assets with APM

APM is a comprehensive tool with many aspects and features.  You will:

- Login to APM
- View an Asset Health Summary
- View a Policy Designer screen which was used to define Alerts and Summary info
- See an Asset Strategy analysis to highlight the very expensive Event you entered

It is assumed you have your own APM environment, please follow [these tutorials](https://www.predix.io/resources/tutorials/journey.html#2583) to set up your APM and receive the Event record via Predix Time Series using Policy Designer.  Instead of choosing the time series tag **Compressor-CMMS-Compressor-2018.suction-pressure** use **Compressor-CMMS-Compressor-2018.device-event** instead.

## 2. Monitor with a Cloud App

In the quickstart script, you were given an option to upload a cloud app and create your own UAA and Time Series.  Go to that URL and view the data sent to Predix Time Series.
